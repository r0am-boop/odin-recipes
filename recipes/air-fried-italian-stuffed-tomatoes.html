    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 medium tomatoes</li>
        <li>olive oil, as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup cooked brown rice</li>
        <li>⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup crumbled goat cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped toasted walnuts</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, divided, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs, divided</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a grill for medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Brush peaches with a light coating of oil. Place pit side down onto the grill. Grill for 5 minutes, or until the surfaces have nice grill marks. Turn the peaches over, and drizzle with a bit of honey. Place a dollop of the cream cheese spread in the place where the pit was. Grill for 2 to 3 more minutes, or until the filling is warm. Serve immediately.</li>
        <li>Combine cooked rice, Parmesan cheese, goat cheese, walnuts, 1 tablespoon basil, and garlic in a medium bowl. Combine bread crumbs, and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small bowl. Fill tomatoes with rice mixture, then sprinkle with bread crumb mixture. Place stuffed tomatoes into the prepared air fryer basket.</li>
